# ed25519 keygen using Electron

This is a my first Electron application based on some electron sample code i copied from few github repos, it is a keygen and used to generate ed25519 keypair.
I used linux for development. It can create linux and windows apps using `npm run package-linux` and `npm run package-win` respectively, you need wine installed for creating windows app though

Next steps
# Take seed from user input
# use libindy to create keypair
# save keypair with alias in sqlite
# use sqlcipher
